Hi,

Just a minor update: 
I simplified the world a little bit to make it easier and quicker to navigate.

Chapters can now be toggled on and off. 
One advice is to toggle off the current chapter before switching to the next one.

Later in the weekend I have more to add.

Till then, have a wonderful day (or night).

Hi,

This is my journal, my voice of expression.

It's mainly to help me self-reflect and evaluate on things during my own personal learning.

At the same time, it can be useful to someone who reads it who might like to understand certain choices or considerations I make.

Otherwise, any update I make to this world would probably only be understood by me !

So whenever there's something noteworthy, I'll add it here.

There's actually a few things I might like to say but I'll write them next time.

Till then I wish you a wonderful day,
