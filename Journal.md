Below are some streams of consciousness from myself.

The ordered numbers between brackets start from the bottom and go up.

They're mainly divisions of the different thoughts that come to my mind as I develop.

It would be nice to be able to write and take notes is something I have had in mind.

So I have now added functionality for this.

Is it finalized? Not yet.

There's another thing I have had on my radar: making it possible to read together in tandem (i.e., synchronizing the pages).

A good use case is, for instance, to help with reading and annotating when explaining if with someone else.

I have yet to learn how to achieve this. When I learn how to, I will provide an option to sync or not for convenience.

A minor note about the white panel: if you scroll down to the bottom of the chapter menu that's near the video player you'll see a button labelled CSM which you can click. 

That will load the first chapter of Chainsaw Man. 

There's a bit of experimenting going on and I am yet undecided how to display images.

At the moment, the images for CSM are being loaded in via the game's Image Loading mechanic - it basically reduces the need to update as often just to update image content.

The drawback, if there is one, is that there's a wait time for images to load. If an image doesn't seem to load, clicking the CSM button mentioned earlier once or a few times can help.

I am still evaluating this method. 

On one hand, it helps to reduce world size and having to redownload per new update.

On the other, waiting for images to load is not fun!

The first update of several to come will be a quick fix so that chapters aren't shown all at once by default.

I built the world again but it seems the game has published it officially.

It's a work in progress - I'm currently working on it as I write this so there's going to be some updates in a bit.

Accidentally closed the Unity window during a recent build without saving progress. I shall sleep.

Unity crashes multiple times, must inhale and exhale.

Why have I chosen to adopt a manga/comic, specifically Chainsaw Man, into this world (as well as my Spanish world)?

- Reading through immersion-

This world has a self-contained textbook resource which, if learned properly, provides a strong foundation for Arabic grammar to be able to construct correct sentences as well as a lot of vocabulary to express one's ideas.

However, reading a grammar textbook can be a bit daunting (and maybe even scary). On the other hand, reading Chainsaw Man in a foreign language might be more appealing, at least to some, myself absolutely included.

In my case, I only ever started reading the second part of the narrative and only watched a video essay that discussed some of the first part's plot. So reading it in a foreign language is something which I enjoy. 

Visual stories come with the advantage that they are easier to absorb and follow, which is helpful for a beginner or relatively new learner. Hence, one other reason why I chose Chainsaw Man is because it isn't too verbose. I was originally considering Spy X Family to read, which is a nice slice of life story which grown ups and kids equally enjoy: though, surprisingly, that turned out to be more complicated to read because it had more dialogue lines per page.

I am absolutely considering adding a text-only narratives. The main reason is because they're a more advanced reource for developing reading and comprehension skills which are great for bookworm-y individuals that like to go the extra mile to achieve greater creativity. I haven't decided which starting book to pick yet; while it is straightforward to add, I am considering how to optimize my worlds' sizes because there's a tradeoff between having higher resolution content and maintaining a reasonable world size.

Unity is amazing.

I want to learn and understand it better.

If I learn more about how to use Unity, I reduce my limitations.

Learning is amazing.

Oh my, I have done something quite silly.

Time to tidy up a bit.

First, I'm going to adjust the position of some things in the world.

Second, I'm going to add a video guide and provide reading content.

Third, I'm going to refine the video player which I (accidentally) broke.

Fourth, I'm going to drink water.
