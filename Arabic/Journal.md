Perhaps I'm bad at keeping journals.

(Personal remark 1: The picture of Harry Potter in the first chapter is pretty amusing.)

(Personal remark 2: After reading some pages from the Harry Potter book, it looks like this is The Chamber of Secrets, not the Philosopher's Stone ! While I was going to replace this as soon as I noticed it, when comparing both books, The Philosopher's Stone surprisingly has a lot more words per page (twice as much, which is a bit scary !). The Chamber of Secrets, on the other hand, looks simpler to read with fewer words per page and so it feels more accessible for a first read so I am going to keep it.)
