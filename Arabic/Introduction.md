An Overview of the World

I made this world as a haven as well as a learning sandbox for myself.

The motivation for this world was to create an environment saturated with knowledge.

But an abundance of knowledge is really only valuable to whoever is interested in acquiring it.

If reading and writing is something you enjoy doing and you generally find learning fun, then you might like the theme of this world.

The grammar chapters covered in this world are comprehensive. If you are trying them out and they feel a bit overwhelming at first, remember, there's no rush so just go at your own rhythm.

While there is an independent glossary to help with vocabulary, the Reverso application is likely better for looking words up or for searching up verb conjugations.

There are synced and desynced variants for learning materials.

If you toggle the information icon on the video player's UI, there's some recommendations for video resources as well.

Some useful things to keep a note of:

	- If using the synced resources, there's a special pen which, when held, transfers ownership of the synced learning resource to its wielder.
	
	- A new manga chapter is updated into the world typically each week with images being loaded in using a queuing system. You might notice two toggle buttons next to the manga panels. The one on top is a refresh button for loading in images. The lower button toggles the panel off (similar to other panels seen around the world).
	
	- There's boards that can be toggled on via the menu to help make writing neater.
	
	- If you do like taking notes and would like a way to save your progress, one simple way of doing so would be to take screenshots and store them. It would be very impressive if you are that organized with your learning and actually do something similar to this!
	
	- It's easier to handwrite in VR but typing is an alternative for desktop-oriented users, especially for any learner that doesn't have access to a VR device. One possible solution could be using software like OneNote to take notes and an overlaying application such as WindowTop.
	
	- The reason for using manga as a resource for learning is because images make it easier to grasp what's going on and it's more accessible to new learners, besides the fact that some stories are also very enjoyable (at least for some!). Also for some, reading literature might be considered the next step they need to advance themselves so this is something that might just be on the roadmap!
