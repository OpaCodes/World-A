Reading can be fun so I have added a separate book that can be read in each world. For French, I have chosen the story of The Three Musketeers; for Spanish, I have chosen Treasure Island; and for Arabic, well, Harry Potter because why not.

While it can be fun to read, it can also be a bit overwhelming at first. Currently, regular updates of 5 new pages are made every (I haven't decided yet) weeks. I am considering 5 pages because it feels like a good balance: not too little but also not so much as to be too overwhelming.

The motto is: read a bit, then maybe a bit more as reading becomes more comfortable and the habit begins to develop, and then, if reading becomes really fun, then... maybe read a lot !
