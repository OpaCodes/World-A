There's a baby pen, you may have noticed. The reason why it exists is because I wanted to experiment a little bit. It can be a surprise how much neater writing can turn out when writing with a small pen in a 3D space.

Another thing I realized is that changing to locomotion from free-move to teleport mode makes writing on a surface feel a lot more natural. Trying it is better than me explaining it perhaps.

I have been enjoying the events idea so far. As for my journal, I have been putting thought into it because I have never really written a journal before; at least, I don't remember having one. Because of this, I have been questioning a bit about things like: 'How to write a journal?' and 'How to layout a journal?' as well as 'How to be consistent in writing a journal?' and...

Anyway, I have been enjoying the events idea a lot. There's more which I would like to say but I'll save it for another time.

That said, I wish you a wonderful day.

Reading can be fun so I have added a separate book that can be read in each world. For French, I have chosen the story of The Three Musketeers; for Spanish, I have chosen Treasure Island; and for Arabic, well, Harry Potter because why not.

While it can be fun to read, it can also be a bit overwhelming at first. Currently, regular updates of 5 new pages are made every (I haven't decided yet) weeks. I am considering 5 pages because it feels like a good balance: not too little but also not so much as to be too overwhelming.

The motto is: read a bit, then maybe a bit more as reading becomes more comfortable and the habit begins to develop, and then, if reading becomes really fun, then... maybe read a lot !
