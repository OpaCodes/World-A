Watching the film: Encanto

__________________________________

Events are an experimental idea. For me, they're an excuse to watch films or series that I have been meaning to watch and would have otherwise watched by myself ! 

But for you, you might like to use them to connect with other learners of the language.

So the motivation for events is to serve as a bridge for connecting learners.

Also, from a personal encounter, there is at least one lovely French speaker who liked the concept of this world and wished to offer their support so this approach might lead to easier and more convenient connections with French speakers who love to help or are mutually trying to improve in their target language as well.

I can arrange the times for events if this can be helpful. A bit surprisingly, I hadn't conceived this world originally to be used for exchanges because I have a question mark if those usually work well or not since they seem to be more subjective; instead, my goal for this world has been to create a learning sandbox that provides helpful resources to facilitate learning but leaves users of the world to be in charge of how they use it, if they will use it!

This world is in its infancy and so is my voice so I'll be relying on writing to communicate. I am interested to observe how this learning haven develops so I want to allow its development to happen by itself. 

I'm not a teacher, just a hobbyist: if there's something I know and can share to help with your learning, I will try to the best of my ability to do what I can. 

My mantra is: No rush and no expectations, do it for the fun and see where it goes.

I don't antipicate the world being full during an event because it's a bit niche and that's partially why I kept the player count as low as it is. But if there's no more room to join and you would like to, feel free to add me: from what I understand, the maximum player count in a world doubles if friends join.

With that said, have a wonderful day and perhaps enjoy them film if you decide to hop by !
